I am super happy because this is the first rev engineering challenge that I was able to solve entirely on my own. It wasn't too hard though.

I downloaded the files, realized it was an elf file and decided to open it in ghidra as usual. As I went through the functions, I noticed one that looked like main. It had this printed in it

  local_20 = 0x4e5f3463665f34;
  printf("What\'s my favorite number? ");
  __isoc99_scanf();
  if (local_48 == 0x86187) {
    __s = (char *)FUN_00101249(0,&local_38);
    fputs(__s,stdout);
    putchar(10);
    free(__s);
  }
  
  So I ran the file on my terminal. It wouldn't run and I realized I had to use chmod +x to get it running.Once it ran I typed in 10 and that didn't work out. I went through the file again and typed in 86167 and 0x86187. Both of which didn't really work. I then decided to convert the hexadecimal to decimal online and then entered the number to get the flag.
  
  I was enthralled, to say the least.
