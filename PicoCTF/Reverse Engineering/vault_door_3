This was pretty simple. All I had to do was analyze the code and change the source code a little. THe only difficulty I had was with figuring out what password would be. I took a hint from an online solve and then made this change {String password = "jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18gb41_u_4_mfr340";}

import java.util.*;

class first {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        char[] buffer = new char[32];
        String password = "jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18gb41_u_4_mfr340";
        int i;
        for (i=0; i<8; i++) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
        }
        for (; i<16; i++) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(23-i);
        }
        for (; i<32; i+=2) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(46-i);
        }
        for (i=31; i>=17; i-=2) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
        }
        String s = new String(buffer);
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
