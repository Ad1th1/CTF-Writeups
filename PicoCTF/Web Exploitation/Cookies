Problem Statement:
Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/

Points: 40

Hints:
None

Solution:
Go to burpsuite and intercept the website. Change the cookie values and then send it to intruder. Check the lengthof the payloads from -1 to 30. You will notice that the payload length is weird for 18. Check the respose for 18 and you will find the flag there.

Issues:
For some reason, I was unable tochange my cookie values on Chrome or Chromium and had to use Firefox. I also had to configure Firefox for Burpsuite.
