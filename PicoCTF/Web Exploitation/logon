Problem Statement:
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:13594

Points: 100

Hints:
1. Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?

Solution:
Just had to change the cookie value of admin to True.
Again, this worked on Mozilla Firefox and noton Google Chrome
