I first used gunzip to find an image. I tried strings and cat. Those didn't work.
I then looked up some writeups and tried this thing called qemu. That didnt really work

I then saw Martin Carlisle's video and tried fls -r on the file. 
The linux partition began at 2048 - so I did  fls -r dds2-alpine.flag.img -o 2048 | grep down

The hint had mentioned a file called down-at-the bottom-text. 
The output stated that the file had a node of 18291

I thus tried out icat 
icat ./dds2-alpine.flag.img -o 2048 18291

and got the flag in
