Problem Statement:
The most revolutionary game is finally available: seed sPRiNG is open right now! seed_spring. Connect to it with nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 8311.

Points: 350

Hints:
1. How is that program deciding what the height is?
2. You and the program should sync up!

Solution:
Read the source code using a Ghidra decompiler.
Realize you need a srand file and make one in C using a nano file.
This is seed.c file I made (with Yash's help)

gcc -o seed seed.c
./seed | nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 8311
Then you get the flag


Information:
In computing, the Executable and Linkable Format[2] (ELF, formerly named Extensible Linking Format), is a common standard file format for executable files, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps. 

Binary exploitation involves taking advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behaviour in the problem.

Ghidra is a free and open source reverse engineering tool developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States. 

for an exe.c file
Use "gcc -Wall ex1.c -o ex1" to compile and "./exe.c" to run

Issues faced:
didn't work even after I compiled the code. 

Flag:
