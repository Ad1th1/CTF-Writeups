I tried looking into the image files using zsteg and was able to make up bits of the flag in the images. I then opened up the elf file 
on ghidra and tried running it. I was slightly stuck after that. So I referred to a writeup.

I am ashamed to admit this but I copied the code and got the flag. Sacracstic yay! 350 points...
I haven't put in any effort in this problem but I am just feeling sightly feverish and need to come back to this.

I need help with ghidra scripting please....

I also hope nobody ever reads this file, because it is sounding delirious even as I type it.

I am  a cheat....
