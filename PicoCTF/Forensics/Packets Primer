This one was easy.
I first opened it on wireshark but since this was a question that had been asked only for a 100 points. I decided to analyze the file first.
I applied cat grep and echo. I finally used strings and got the flag.
This is a command I used to get rid of the whitespace.

strings network-dump.flag.pcap | grep "p i c o" | tr -d ' '
