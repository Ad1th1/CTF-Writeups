Information:
The Wiener's attack, named after cryptologist Michael J. Wiener, is a type of cryptographic attack against RSA. The attack uses the 
continued fraction method to expose the private key d when d is small.

For some reason, RSA had always freaked me out and I had forever been dreading this problem. 

It was pretty easy. I just threw the numbers into an RSA decoder and got the answer, easy as that.

 On a more general basis, if the size of d is lower than 0.29 times the size of n (in bits) then there exists an efficient key recovery
 attack. The accepted wisdom is that trying to get a d much smaller than n is a bad idea for security.
