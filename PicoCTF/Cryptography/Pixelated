Problem Statement:
I have these 2 images, can you make a flag out of them? scrambled1.png scrambled2.png

Points: 100

Hints:
1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cryptography
2. Think of different ways you can "stack" images

Solution:
Just had to install stegsolve.jar and learnt how to run it.
Just combined the two images and tried out a bunch of stuff before getting the flag

Information:

In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a single-use pre-shared key that is not smaller than the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition.

JAR is the abbreviation for Java Archive files. As the name says, it is an archive file. The archive file is a single file that has other files packed together to decrease storage space, probability of error, and many similar reasons. They are very much like ZIP files, the only difference being that it is used by the Java Runtime Environment.
