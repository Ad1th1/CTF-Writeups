Problem Statement:
A one-time pad is unbreakable, but can you manage to recover the flag? (Wrap with picoCTF{}) nc mercury.picoctf.net 36981 otp.py

Points: 40

Hints:
1. Maybe there's a way to make this a 2x pad.

Solution:
I just copied the code from a writeup. Have not really understood the solution



Information:
Pwntools is a CTF framework and exploit development library. Written in Python, it is designed for rapid prototyping and development, and intended to make exploit writing as simple as possible.

Flag:
picoCTF{7f9da29f40499a98db220380a57746a4}

Copied code
from pwn import *

KEY_LEN = 50000
MAX_CHUNK = 1000

r = remote("mercury.picoctf.net", 36981)
r.recvuntil("This is the encrypted flag!\n")
flag = r.recvlineS(keepends = False)
log.info("Flag: {flag}")
bin_flag = unhex(flag)

counter = KEY_LEN - len(bin_flag)

with log.progress('Causing wrap-around') as p:
    while counter > 0:
        p.status("{counter} bytes left")
        chunk_size = min(MAX_CHUNK, counter)
        r.sendlineafter("What data would you like to encrypt? ", "a" * chunk_size)
        
        counter -= chunk_size

r.sendlineafter("What data would you like to encrypt? ", bin_flag)
r.recvlineS()
log.success("The flag: {}".format(unhex(r.recvlineS())))
