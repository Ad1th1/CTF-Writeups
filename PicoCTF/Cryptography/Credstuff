This one was pretty easy and I am a lil too proud to say that I did it without referring to a write-up.

I mostly downloaded the file and did a grep command to find the line number the given username was located at.
I struggled a little with this. I tried opening a vim editor and adding line numbers, but eventually just decided to go with grep -n

Then I went through passwords.txt, printed passwords until line 378. Found a bit of text that was seemingly the flag.

Since this was a cryptography question, I assumed it was either rot or a Caeser cipher.

I checked out a caeser decoder first and found the flag.
