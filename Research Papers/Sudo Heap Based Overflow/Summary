Vulnerability:
If Sudo is executed to run a command in "shell" mode (shell -c command):

- either through the -s option, which sets Sudo's MODE_SHELL flag;

- or through the -i option, which sets Sudo's MODE_SHELL and
  MODE_LOGIN_SHELL flags;

then, at the beginning of Sudo's main(), parse_args() rewrites argv
(lines 609-617), by concatenating all command-line arguments (lines
587-595) and by escaping all meta-characters with backslashes (lines
590-591):
