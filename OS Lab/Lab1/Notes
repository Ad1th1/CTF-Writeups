-> shell = envt. to run commands, programs and scripts
-> shell prompt $ = command prompt created by shell
-> 2 major types of shells:
  1. C shell 
  2. Bourne Shell
-> original Unix shell = written in 1970's by Stephen R Bourne
-> Bourne shell is installed as /bin/sh on most UNIX versions

\ = escape character
/ = directory seperator
. = Current directory
.. = Parent directory
~ = User home directory
* = 0 or more characters in a file name
? = single character in a filename
[] = range of values
| = pipe
> = redirect output of a command into a new file, owerwrites
>> = appends output of a command into a new file
< = redirects file as input to a program
<< = reads from stream literal
<<< = reads from a string
; = command seperator
