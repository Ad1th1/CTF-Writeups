-> Classical synchronization problem
-> database to be shared among concurrent processes
-> some processes may only want to read the database whereas others may want to update(read and write) the database
-> former = reader and latter = writer
-> if 2 readers access shared data simultaneously, it is fine
-> if a writer and reader access data simultaneously, there is an issue
-> Therefore, writers must have exclusive access to data

2 semaphores and 1 integer variable
1. mutex = semaphore(initialized to one) => used to ensure mutual exclusion when readcount is updated
ie: when a reader enters or exits from the critical section
2. wrt, semaphore, initialized to 1, common to both reader and writer processes
3. readcount = integer variable, initialized to 0, to keep track of how many are currently reading the process

Writer:
do{
//writer requests critical section
wait(wrt);
/* performs write */
//leaves critical section
signal(wrt);

}while(true)

Reader:
do{
  wait(mutex);
  readcnt++;    // number of readers has increased by 1
  if(readcnt==1)
  wait(wrt);    // to ensure that no writer can enter if there is even one reader
  signal(mutex);  //other readers can enter while current reader is inside the critical section

/* current reader performs reading */
   wait(mutex);
   readcnt--;   //reader wants to leave
   if(readcnt == 0)   //no reader in criical section
    signal(wrt);  //writer can enter
    signal(mutex);  //reader leaves

}while(true);
